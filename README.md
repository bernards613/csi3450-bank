# CSI 3450 (DB Design & Implementation) Bank
Welcome to BankSQL! This project involves the display of a database for a bank to view banks, people, accounts, loans, and transactions in the database. The project involves a frontend that displays all the information requested and allows the user to view their desired data based by filters, and a backend that controls all the requests from the bank database.

## Setup

1. Clone the repo to your computer `git clone https://github.com/declspecl/csi3450-bank.git`
2. Create a PostgreSQL database named `bank` with the user `postgres` and the password `postgres`. If you cannot do this (for ex. you cannot set the password to `postgres`, just update the Python scripts to your password (but don't commit it :D))
3. Navigate into `bank-backend`, `bank-frontend`, and `scripts` and read their README.md files respectively to set those environments up
